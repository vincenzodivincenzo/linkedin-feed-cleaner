## Privacy & Security

- **No Data Collection**: Zero user data is collected, stored externally, or transmitted
- **Minimal Permissions**: Only requires `storage` permission for saving your preferences
- **LinkedIn-Only**: Only operates on LinkedIn domains
- **No Background Scripts**: No persistent background processes
- **No External API Calls**: All filtering happens locally in your browser
- **Open Source**: Full transparency in functionality

## Security Comparison

Unlike many "free" LinkedIn extensions that:
- Extract cookies and session tokens
- Harvest your connection lists
- Make unauthorized API calls
- Require excessive permissions

This extension:
- Uses only DOM manipulation for content filtering
- Stores settings locally on your device only
- Requires minimal permissions
- Contains no tracking or analytics
- Has no external dependencies

## Development

The extension consists of:
- `manifest.json`: Extension configuration with minimal permissions
- `content.js`: Content script for DOM manipulation
- `popup.html/js`: Settings interface
- `styles.css`: Smooth transition styling

## Contributing

Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to improve the extension's functionality while maintaining its privacy-first approach.

## Nerd Note: How it avoids detection

We use a MutationObserver to catch dynamic content changes (LinkedIn loves infinite scroll garbage).  
But we debounce the cleanup to run **at most once every 500ms**, so it doesn't look like a bot hammering the DOM.  
All filtering is cosmeticâ€”no layout rewriting, no injected behavior, no stored sessions.
